 Interactive Web Interface: A Modern Front-End Showcase

Welcome to my personal web interface, a project that goes beyond a simple static portfolio. My name is **Sarvesh**, and I'm a front-end developer with a passion for building applications that are not only functional but also intuitive, visually engaging, and a delight to use. This project is a direct reflection of that philosophy. I believe in writing clean, efficient code and paying close attention to the small details that elevate a user's experience from standard to exceptional. This isn't just a page to display information; it's an interactive space designed to demonstrate what a modern, user-centric web experience feels like.


## ‚ú® Key Features

This web interface is packed with features designed to showcase modern web development techniques and a keen eye for UI/UX:

* **Seamless Single-Page Application (SPA) Experience**: Navigate between Home, Contact, Feedback, and the Planner instantly without any page reloads. The interface uses custom JavaScript to dynamically display content, resulting in a fast, fluid, and app-like user experience.
* **Dual-Theme Functionality (Light & Dark Mode)**: A sleek, modern theme switcher allows users to toggle between a bright, clean light mode and a sophisticated, eye-friendly dark mode. The theming is implemented efficiently using CSS variables for easy maintenance and scalability.
* **Interactive Daily Planner**: A fully functional to-do list application built from scratch.
    * **Add Tasks**: Quickly add new tasks via an input field. Pressing 'Enter' or clicking the 'Add' button works.
    * **Smooth Animated Deletion**: Deleting a task triggers a satisfying `fadeOut` animation before the item is removed from the DOM, providing a polished and non-jarring user interaction.
    * **Smart UX**: The input field automatically clears and re-focuses after a task is added, streamlining the process of adding multiple items.
* **Modern & Responsive Design**: The entire layout is built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a perfect, intuitive experience on any device, from a large desktop monitor to a small smartphone screen. The UI uses modern CSS, including a "glassmorphism" effect on the navigation bar for a touch of contemporary design.
* **Engaging Micro-interactions**: Hover effects on links, animated card pop-ups, and smooth section transitions are implemented throughout the site to create a lively and responsive feel.

 üöÄ Why This Project is Unique

Many portfolios are static pages that simply list skills and projects. This interface is different. It's a **living demonstration of my capabilities**. Instead of just *telling* you I can build interactive features, I'm *showing* you.

* **Focus on User Experience (UX)**: This project was built with the end-user as the top priority. Features like the instant theme-switching and animated task management are designed to be intuitive and enjoyable. This user-centric approach is what separates a great website from a merely functional one.
* **Attention to Detail**: I believe that excellence lies in the details. The subtle animations, the clean code structure, and the thoughtful transitions are a testament to my commitment to quality. For instance, the task deletion isn't abrupt; the CSS animation provides visual feedback that makes the application feel more professional and polished.
* **Hand-crafted Interactivity**: The core interactive components, like the SPA navigation and the daily planner, were built from the ground up using vanilla JavaScript. This demonstrates a deep understanding of the language and the DOM, without relying on heavy frameworks for core functionality. It showcases my ability to write efficient, self-contained, and performant code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Showcase

This project leverages a curated stack of core web technologies to achieve its goals:

* **HTML5**: Written with semantic markup for better accessibility and SEO.
* **CSS3**: Styled with modern and advanced CSS features:
    * **CSS Variables (Custom Properties)**: For clean, maintainable, and powerful theming.
    * **Flexbox**: For creating sophisticated, responsive layouts.
    * **Custom Animations & Transitions (`@keyframes`)**: To bring the user interface to life.
    * **Advanced Selectors & Pseudo-classes**: For precise styling and interactive effects.
    * **`backdrop-filter`**: To achieve the modern "glassmorphism" UI effect.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**:
    * **DOM Manipulation**: All dynamic content and interactivity are handled through direct, efficient manipulation of the Document Object Model.
    * **Event Handling**: Robust event listeners manage all user interactions, from clicks to form submissions.
    * **Modular Logic**: The code is organized logically, with clear functions for handling navigation, theme switching, and the planner's functionality.

This project is a testament to my skills and my passion for web development. Feel free to explore the code, test the features, and see for yourself!
