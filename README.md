# Dynamic-Web-Interface-Showcase
Interactive Web Interface: A detailed front-end showcase with a theme switcher, SPA navigation, &amp; a daily planner. This project is unique because it's a living demonstration of UI/UX skills, not a static site. Hand-crafted with vanilla JS, its focus on smooth animations &amp; user-centric design sets it apart from typical portfolio projects.
